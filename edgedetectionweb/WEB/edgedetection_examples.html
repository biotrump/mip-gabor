<h3>0) Gabor filter</h3>

Select the following <a href="edgedetection_params.html#params" target="_blank">parameter</a> values:
<ul>
  <li>Input image = synthetic1.png
  <li>Wavelength = 1 ; Orientation(s) (deg.) = 0 ; Phase offset(s) (deg.) = 90; Aspect Ratio = 0.5 ; Bandwidth = 1 ; Number of orientations = 1
  <li>Enable HWR = not checked
  <li>Superposition of phases = L2 norm
  <li>Select inhibition type = No surround inhibition
  <li>Enable thinning = not checked ; Enable hysteresis thresholding = not checked
</ul>
This filter deploys an <b>antisymmetric Gabor function</b> (phase offset
90 or -90 degrees) and gives a maximum response at an edge.
Observe the response of the filter to the edge (black to white
transition) in the lower part of the input image. The response is
maximal exactly at the edge. There are two flanking responses (and you
can observe a larger number of such flanking responses if you take a
smaller bandwidth, e.g. 0.5) that are due to the ripples of the Gabor
function, but you can remove them by enabling halfwave rectification
with a HWR threshold=40(%).<p>

Take now a filter that deploys a <b>symmetric Gabor function</b> (phase
offset 0 or 180 degrees). Observe the response of that filter to the
concerned edge - the maximum is shifted from the edge, there are
actually two maxima - one to the left and the other to the right of the
edge. A the same time, a symmetric filter gives a maximum response to a
line of appropriate width whereby the response is centered on the line -
observe the response of the filter to the vertical line in the middle of
the image.<p>

To conclude, symmetric and antisymmetric Gabor filters are good
(localization) detectors of lines and edges, respectively.
You can read more on this in <a href="edgedetection_params.html#references" target="_blank">references</a> [2] and [3].
A complex Gabor function that combines a symmetric real and an antisymmetric imaginary part has optimal joint
localization properties in the spatial and the spatial frequency domain (see
<a href="edgedetection_params.html#references" target="_blank">reference</a> [1]).

<!-- Example 1 -->

<a name="ex1"></a>
<h3>1) Gabor energy filter</h3>
Select the following <a href="edgedetection_params.html#params" target="_blank">parameter</a> values:
<ul>
  <li>Input image = synthetic1.png
  <li>Wavelength = 8 ; Orientation(s) (deg.) = 0 ; Phase offset(s) (deg.) = 0, 90 ; Aspect Ratio = 0.5 ; Bandwidth = 1 ; Number of orientations = 8
  <li>Enable HWR = not checked
  <li>Superposition of phases = L2 norm
  <li>Select inhibition type = No surround inhibition
  <li>Enable thinning = not checked ; Enable hysteresis thresholding = not checked
</ul>

Observe that the responses to all lines and edges in the output image are (approximately) equally strong. 
(See also Fig.7 in <a href="edgedetection_params.html#references" target="_blank">reference</a> [6] and Fig.6 in <a href="edgedetection_params.html#references" target="_blank">reference</a> [7].)<p>

A positive aspect of the Gabor energy filter in comparison with the
simple linear Gabor filters (see <a href="#ex0">Example 0</a>) is that this filter gives a
smooth response to an edge or a line of appropriate width with a local
maximum exactly at the edge or in the center of the line. If you now
apply thinning on this response, you will get one thin line that follows
the corresponding edge or line. In contrast, the simple linear Gabor
filters give flanking responses (due to the ripples of the Gabor
function). Without appropriate local half-wave rectification, these
flanking responses can cause problems in the thinning stage.
(We thank Dr. John Daugman for his comments on this aspect of the Gabor
energy filter.)
<p>
The Gabor energy filter is often used in texture processing, see <a href="edgedetection_params.html#references" target="_blank">references</a> [4] and [5].

<!-- Example 2 -->

<a name="ex2"></a>
<h3>2) Effect of anisotropic surround inhibition</h3>
Most of the <a href="edgedetection_params.html#params" target="_blank">parameters</a> have values as in Example 1 but surround inhibition is enabled.
<ul>
  <li>Input image = synthetic1.png
  <li>Wavelength = 8 ; Orientation(s) (deg.) = 0 ; Phase offset(s) (deg.) = 0, 90 ; Aspect Ratio = 0.5 ; Bandwidth = 1 ; Number of orientations = 8
  <li>Enable HWR = not checked 
  <li>Superposition of phases = L2 norm
  <li>Select inhibition type = Anisotropic surround inhibition ; Alpha = 1 ; K1 = 1 ; K2 = 4
  <li>Enable thinning = not checked ;  Enable hysteresis thresholding = not checked
</ul>
Observe that the strength of the response to lines that are part of the vertical and oblique gratings is reduced compared to Example 1. Increase the value of Alpha (strength of surround inhibition) to 1.5 to further decrease these responses, and then to 2 to see how they disappear completely. In contrast, the response to the vertical line where it is not surrounded by other such lines remains strong. (See also Fig.7 in <a href="edgedetection_params.html#references" target="_blank">reference</a> [6] and Fig.6 in <a href="edgedetection_params.html#references" target="_blank">reference</a> [7].)

<!-- Example 3 -->
<hr>
<a name="ex3"></a>
<h3>3) Effect of isotropic surround inhibition</h3>
All <a href="edgedetection_params.html#params" target="_blank">parameters</a> but <i>Select inhibition type</i> have the same values as in Example 2. Choose:
<ul>
  <li> Select inhibition type = Isotropic surround inhibition ; Superposition for isotropic inhibition = L-infinity norm 
</ul>
Increase Alpha from 1 to 1.5 and then to 2 to observe how the response to all lines that are surrounded by other lines will decrease and finally completely disappear (for Alpha = 2). (See also Fig.7 in <a href="edgedetection_params.html#references" target="_blank">reference</a> [6] and Fig.6 in <a href="edgedetection_params.html#references" target="_blank">reference</a> [7].)

<!-- Example 4 -->

<a name="ex4"></a>
<h3>4) Orientation-contrast pop-out and its relation to anisotropic surround inhibition</h3> 
The input image popout.png illustrates a perceptual effect know as orientation-contrast pop-out. 
A single vertical bar that is embedded in a group of horizontal bars segregates, or "pops out", from its surrondings.<p>
 
<b>a) Gabor-energy filtering</b><br>
A pixel value in the output models the response of a complex cell that is responsible for that point of the visual field. 
Select the following <a href="edgedetection_params.html#params" target="_blank">parameter</a> values: 
<ul>
  <li>Input image = popout.png 
  <li>Wavelength = 8 ; Orientation(s) (deg.) = 0 ; Phase offset(s) (deg.) = 0, 90 ; Aspect Ratio = 0.5 ; Bandwidth = 1 ; Number of orientations = 4 
  <li>Enable HWR = not checked 
  <li>Superposition of phases = L2 norm 
  <li>Select inhibition type = No surround inhibition 
  <li>Enable thinning = not checked ; Enable hysteresis thresholding = not checked
</ul>
 Observe that the responses to all bars in the output image are (approximately) equally strong. 
Hence, the responses of complex cells according to the Gabor-energy model cannot explain the difference in the perception
of the single vertical bar vs. the group of horizontal bars.<p> 

<b>b) Gabor-energy filtering augmented with anisotropic surround inhibition</b><br>
Select the <a href="edgedetection_params.html#params" target="_blank">parameter</a> values as under a) above, but now set 
<ul>
  <li>Select inhibition type = Anisotropic surround inhibition
</ul>
Carry out a series of simulations in which you increase the value of the parameter Alpha, starting with
<ul>
  <li>Alpha = 2
</ul>
and increasing it to Alpha = 3 and then Alpha = 4.<p>
Observe how the responses to the horizontal bars in the output image are reduced due to the surround suppression
 mechanism in which bars of the same orientation inhibit each other. The response to the vertical bar is not inhibited because this bar is alone 
- there is no other such bar in its vicinity. This type of suppression is called anisotropic because the strength of response
 suppression depends on the mutual orientation of the stimuli: it is strongest for parallel and weakest for orthogonal stimuli. 
(See also Fig.7 in <a href="edgedetection_params.html#references" target="_blank">reference</a> [6] and Fig.6 in 
<a href="edgedetection_params.html#references" target="_blank">reference</a> [7].)

<hr>
<a name="ex5"></a><h3>5) Decreased saliency of contours embedded in gratings and its relation
to anisotropic surround inhibition</h3>

Select as an input image triangle.png. It is a modified version of an
image due to Galli and Zama [1931 Zeitschrift für Psychologie 31
308-348]. A triangle is superimposed on a grating of bars. While two of
the triangle's legs are very salient, the third leg which coincides with
one bar of the grating is not perceived as part of the triangle at all:
our visual system groups it with the grating bars rather than with the
other legs of the triangle.<p>

Select the following <a href="edgedetection_params.html#params" target="_blank">parameter</a> values: 

<ul>
  <li>Input image = triangle.png 
  <li>Wavelength = 20 ; Orientation(s) (deg.) = 30,90,150 ; Phase offset(s)
(deg.) = 0, 90 ; Aspect Ratio = 0.5 ; Bandwidth = 1 ; Number of
orientations = (leave empty) 
  <li>Enable HWR = not checked 
  <li>Superposition of phases = L2 norm 
  <li>Select inhibition type = Anisotropic surround inhibition
  <li>Enable thinning = not checked ; Enable hysteresis thresholding = not
checked 
</ul>
Start with inhibition strength
<ul>
  <li>Alpha = 0
</ul>
which corresponds to no inhibition. Observe that there is strong
response (indicated by light colour) in the output image in the area
covered by the grating in the input image. The response to the two legs
of the triangle which are not parallel to the grating bars is weaker.
This is in contrast to the perceived strong saliency of these two legs.
<p>
Increase the inhibition strength Alpha first to Alpha = 0.7, then to
Alpha = 1 and then to Alpha = 2.
<p>
For Alpha = 0.7 the response to the bars of the grating is approximately
as strong as the response to the two legs of the triangle. This is
achieved by reducing the response to the grating due to surround
inhibition: the responses to the bars of the grating inhibit each other
and all such responses are collectively reduced. No such suppression is
excercised on the legs of the triangle which have different orientation.
<p>
For Alpha = 1 the response to the bars of the grating is further reduced
and is considerably smaller than the response to the two legs of the
triangle. This mimicks the observed effect of increased saliency of
these two legs vs. the third leg that is part of the grating.
<p>
For Alpha = 2 only response to the two concerned legs of the triangle is observed
in the output. (See also Fig.8 in <a href="edgedetection_params.html#references" target="_blank">reference</a> [6].)

now dominated by the contours of the rhinocerus. This output image is
more useful for contour based object recognition. The observed effect supports the
idea that the biological utility of non-classical receptive field
inhibition is the quick pre-attentive detection of contours and their
separation from texture edges. This would help a human or an animal to
quickly detect an object of interest in a surroundings rich in texture
edges. (For further information on this topic, see <a href="edgedetection_params.html#references" target="_blank">references</a> [6] and [7].)

<h3>7) Filter bank of Gabor energy filters for texture processing
(MPEG-7 browsing descriptors)</h3>

Gabor filters are often used for texture processing. For instance, in
the MPEG-7 standard, texture browsing descriptors are defined and used
that are based on Gabor filters as follows. A bank of Gabor filters with
different preferred orientations and wavelength are applied to an image.
Each of these filters gives as a result a two-dimensional array of the
same size as the input image. The sum of all elements in one such array
is a number that can be used as a descriptor of the input image
regarding the presence of edges of the corresponding orientation and
spatial frequency. In the MPEG-7 standard 6 preferred orientations and 5
preferred wavelengths are used, resulting in a bank of 30 filters that
are used to compute the values of 30 descriptors. These descriptors are
used for browsing in image data bases.
<p>
For texture analysis, the elements of the two-dimensional array that is
output by a Gabor filter are not summed together. Rather, the outputs of
the different Gabor filters used in a filter bank for a given image
position (pixel) are combined in a vector that is associated with the
considered pixel. The number of elements in that vector is equal to the
number of filters in the bank. The vectors associated with the different
pixels can be used, for instance, for segmentation. For further
information on this, see <a href="edgedetection_params.html#references"
target="_blank">references</a> [4] and [5].
<p>
Below we give an example of how to use the program to compute the above
mentioned outputs of Gabor energy filters for six preferred orientations
and one preferred wavelength. To compute outputs for a different
wavelength, the steps given below have to be repeated for each
wavelength value that is needed.

Select the following <a href="edgedetection_params.html#params"
target="_blank">parameter</a> values:
<ul>
 <li>Input image = synthetic1.png (or another image from the list)
 <li>Wavelength = 8 ; Orientation(s) (deg.) = 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 ;
Phase offset(s) (deg.) = 0, 90 ; Aspect Ratio = 0.5 ; Bandwidth = 1 ;
Number of orientations = blank (not used)  <li>Enable HWR = not checked
 <li>Superposition of phases = L2 norm
 <li>Select inhibition type = No surround inhibition
 <li>Enable thinning = not checked ; Enable hysteresis thresholding =
not checked
</ul>

After you press the button 'update view' the outputs of the above six
Gabor filters will be computed and their maximum value (per pixel) will
be displayed in the output window. Now you can select one by one each of
the preferred orientations used (by using the select window at the
bottom of the page and pressing the button 'change orientation') and
visualize and store the outputs of the filters separately.
